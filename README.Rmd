This package embeds various methods for Bayesian inference :

1. computing failure probability (probability that the output of a numerical model exceeds a threshold)
2. computing quantile of low or high-order (optimization with confidence interval)
3. conditional mean estimation with Nested Sampling
3. Cdf estimation over an interval of the form $(-\infty, q]$ with Poisson processes
3. Wilks formula to compute quantile(s) from a sample or the size of the required i.i.d. sample.
